# CODSOFT
This repo was created for my web development internship at codsoft
It contains the Level 1 tasks of the program which includes three tasks. These tasks were all mainly front-end based hence niether any backend code was written nor it has any database related operations. Pure HTML,CSS,JavaScript were used to design and create these web pages with some Font Awesome icons and no additional frameworks like React,NodeJS were used

Task 1 - Landing Page:
The landing page is designed as a website for a pet shop for cats which includes header, about section and the top pets section, the designing was done using HTML,CSS with a little bit of JavaScript without any frameworks

Issues:
        The responsiveness of the page is not good and it includes only the home page

Task 2 - Portfolio:
This was the biggest and the most time consuming task as it isn't designed as a dummy portfolio, but as a primary portfolio for the time being, it includes the header,about,education,experience,skills,projects,contact sections which contain my educational background and technical skills along with links to my social profiles, resume and other files.In this webpage viewers will have the option to switch to dark and light mode and change the color of certain elements from the given color palette in the webpage. Raw HTML,CSS,JavaScript were used along with help of additional libraries like font awesome for icons

Issues:
        Some issues with responsiveness, some colors might not be compatible with the dark/light mode, project section contains the video of the working projects

Task 3 - Calculator:
The task was to create a calculator to perform basic opertaions of mathematics which required JS for the logic and HTML,CSS for the design

Issues:
        It is a very basic calculator hence it cannot handle complex calculations, issues with responsiveness
